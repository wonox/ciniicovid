It includes some categories as follows. i) Exercise: Hippocrates said that walking is the best medicine. Walking fast, climbing stairs, and squats are effective. ii) Sleep and rhythmic lifestyle: Keep sleep and wake up time regularly, avoid looking at display or VDT work before sleep, and have bright light when waking up, especially sunlight. iii) Mental care: The US CDC presents the stressful influences, such as fear and worry about health, worsening of chronic health problems, and increased use of alcohol. Some recommendations of controlling heart and minds include keeping the natural feeling of being as it is, and mindfulness related to the oriental Zen concept. iv) Nutrition: IM and anti-inflammatory diet were proposed by Dr. Andrew Weil at Arizona University. The diet is based on two diets—the Mediterranean diet and the Okinawan diet. v) IM: Several applicable tips for IM show chiropractic, aromatherapy, supplements, medical herbs, Chinese medicine, Ayurveda, acupuncture, and others.","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120006849742'}","21.0","","2.0","","20","Diabetes Research : Open Access","17.0","2.0","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120006849742.json'}","Recommended Hints for Improved Lifestyle and Health from Integrative Medicine (IM) In the Critical Situation of COVID-19"

The purpose of this study is to give a prediction of the epidemic peak for COVID-19 in Japan by using the real-time data from 15 January to 29 February 2020. Taking into account the uncertainty due to the incomplete identification of infective population, we apply the well-known SEIR compartmental model for the prediction. By using a least-square-based method with Poisson noise, we estimate that the basic reproduction number for the epidemic in Japan is R0=2.6 ( 95% CI, 2.4 – 2.8 ) and the epidemic peak could possibly reach the early-middle summer. In addition, we obtain the following epidemiological insights: (1) the essential epidemic size is less likely to be affected by the rate of identification of the actual infective population; (2) the intervention has a positive effect on the delay of the epidemic peak; (3) intervention over a relatively long period is needed to effectively reduce the final epidemic size.","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120006841706'}","","2077-0383","3.0","789.0","20","Journal of Clinical Medicine","","9.0","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120006841706.json'}","Prediction of the Epidemic Peak of Coronavirus Disease in Japan, 2020"

SARS-CoV-2 RNA was confirmed by RT-PCR. A total of 33 (53.2%) of 62 cases with CVD, who had higher prevalence of severe COVID-19 compared with non-CVD patients (P=0.027). The median age of all patients was 66.0 (53.3, 73.0) years old. Coronary artery disease (11.3%) and hypertension (38.7%) were the common coexisting CVDs in COVID-19 patients. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI), creatinine, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, prothrombin time, and D-dimer levels in the severe COVID-19 with CVD group were higher than in the non-severe COVID-19 with CVD group (P&lt;0.05). For all patients, chest computed tomography (CT) showed ground-glass opacity (66.1%), local (21.0%), bilateral (77.4%), and interstitial abnormalities (4.8%).

Increase in blood uric acid level is a frequent side effect of favipiravir.  Here, we discussed the mechanism of blood uric acid elevation during favipiravir treatment.  Favipiravir is metabolized to an inactive metabolite M1 by aldehyde oxidase and xanthine oxidase, and excreted into urine.  In the kidney, uric acid handling is regulated by the balance of reabsorption and tubular secretion in the proximal tubules.  Favipiravir and M1 act as moderate inhibitors of organic anion transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3), which are involved in uric acid excretion in the kidney.  In addition, M1 enhances uric acid reuptake via urate transporter 1 (URAT1) in the renal proximal tubules.  Thus, favipiravir is thought to decrease uric acid excretion into urine, resulting in elevation of uric acid levels in blood.  Elevated uric acid levels were returned to normal after discontinuation of favipiravir, and favipiravir is not used for long periods of time for the treatment of viral infection.  Thus, the effect on blood uric acid levels was subclinical in most studies.  Nevertheless, the adverse effect of favipiravir might be clinically important in patients with a history of gout, hyperuricemia, kidney function impairment (in which blood concentration of M1 increases), and where there is concomitant use of other drugs affecting blood uric acid elevation.&lt;/p&gt;","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007853931'}","90.0","0040-8727","2.0","","20","The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine","87.0","251.0","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007853931.json'}","Uric Acid Elevation by Favipiravir, an Antiviral Drug"

LINE users could participate in the system either though a QR code page in the prefecture's website, or a banner at the top of the LINE app screen. COOPERA asked participants questions regarding personal information, preventive actions, and non-specific symptoms related to COVID-19 and their duration. We calculated daily cross correlation functions between the reported number of infected cases confirmed by PCR and the symptom-positive group captured by COOPERA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed 206,218 participants from three prefectures reported between March 5 and 30, 2020.

The population were divided into three compartments: Susceptible, Infected, Removed. Susceptible transitions to Infected every hour with a probability determined by the ratio of Infected and the congestion of area. The total area consists of three zones crowded zone, mid zone and uncrowded zone, with different infection probabilities characterized by the number of people gathered there. The time for each people to spend in the crowded zone is curtailed by 0, 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8 hours, and the time spent in mid zone is extended accordingly. This simulation showed that the number of Infected and Removed will increase rapidly if there is no reduction of the time spent in crowded zone. On the other hand, the stagnant growth of Infected can be observed when the time spent in the crowded zone is reduced to 4 hours, and the growth number of Infected will decrease and the spread of the infection will subside gradually if the time spent in the crowded zone is further cut to 2 hours.

Italy has become one of the largest epicentres outside Asia, accounting now for at least 80,539 infections (cumulative incidence of 95.9/100,000) and 8,165 deaths (case fatality rate 10.1%). It has seriously affected people above the age of 60 years. The International Health Regulations (IHR) revised in 2005 bind governments to disclose vital information regarding the identification and detection of new disease outbreaks regardless of its causative agent. In contrast to the previous SARS epidemic, China timely informed the world about the onset of a new outbreak. It also soon disclosed the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19. Unfortunately, despite the fast recognition of the Chinese epidemic, the application of the 2005 IHR was not followed by an effective response in every country and most health authorities failed to rapidly perceive the threat posed by COVID-19. To further complicate matters, IHR implementation, which relies primarily on self-reporting data rather than on an external review mechanism, was limited in speed and further hindered by high costs. The response in Italy suffered from several limitations within the health system and services. The action against this threat must instead be quick, firm and at the highest trans-national level. The solution lies in further strengthening countries&apos; preparedness through a clear political commitment, mobilization of proper resources and implementation of a strict surveillance and monitoring process.&lt;/p&gt;","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007841121'}","77.0","2434-9186","2.0","","20","Global Health & Medicine","73.0","2.0","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007841121.json'}","The COVID-19 pandemic preparedness ... or lack thereof: from China to Italy"

Some common problems were found, such as insufficient types and quantities of emergency medical supplies in reserve, insufficient emergency production capacity, and imperfect command mechanism for emergency supplies deployment and transportation. A sound reserve system of emergency medical supplies is the basis and guarantee for dealing with public health emergencies such as major outbreaks. Based on the comparison of systems and practical experience, countries around the world should further improve the reserve and supply system of emergency medical supplies, and improve the coordination and cooperation mechanism for emergency supplies for international public health emergencies, so as to cope with increasingly severe public health emergencies in the context of globalization.&lt;/p&gt;","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007840879'}","","1881-7815","","","20","BioScience Trends","","","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007840879.json'}","An international comparison analysis of reserve and supply system for emergency medical supplies between China, the United States, Australia, and Canada"

Based on our data obtained from an animal infection model of melioidosis (a disease caused by the bacteria &lt;i&gt;Burkholderia pseudomallei&lt;/i&gt;), treatment with chloroquine can result in the phosphorylation and consequent inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β).

The LightMix Modular SARS and Wuhan CoV E-gene (LN S&W-E) assay was highly sensitive for SARS-CoV-2, as was the N2 set, and both assays had perfectly consistent results with the clinical specimens. While the LM S&W-E set targets the highly conserved region of the E gene in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the N2 set was designed to target the unique region in the SARS-CoV-2 N gene.

The medical staff working in the operating room, such as anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses, are at high risk of exposure to virus due to closely contacting patients. The perioperative management is under great challenge while performing surgeries for patients suffering COVID-19, including emergency cesarean section, which is one of the most common surgeries under such circumstances.

The disease was named as COVID-19. Information on the SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequence was first released on 10 January 2020. We urgently started development of genetic diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2. On 14 January, soon after receiving the prototype designed primers, we have received the first clinical specimens suspected for COVID-19. We urgently started assessment of the primers and the laboratory diagnosis testing for SARS-CoV-2 in a parallel way. After the nightlong assessment/testing, the first COVID19 case in Japan was confirmed. The patient was a returnee from Wuhan. Until 22 January, we have established the nested RT-PCR diagnostic method/protocol for SARS-CoV-2, and urgently distributed the primer set/protocol to ～ 80 prefectural public health laboratories (PHLs) nationwide, because the Chun Jie holidays starts in China on 24 January and many Chinese tourists visit Japan. As we concerned, sporadic COVID-19 cases with an epidemiological linkage to Wuhan have detected in Tokyo, Aichi, Nara, Hokkaido, and Osaka prefectures after 24 January. Following the nested RT-PCR method, we have established the real-time RT-PCR diagnostic methods for SARS-CoV-2, and distributed the primer/probe set to ～ 80 PHLs on 30–31 January. However, the laboratory workload increased dramatically, because Japan has started to accept 829 returnees (15 were shown to be SARS-CoV-2-positive later) from Wuhan using government chartered flights on 29 January and screen ～3,500 passengers and crew (&gt;600 were shown to be SARS-CoV-2-positive later) on a cruise ship quarantined in Yokohama for SARS-CoV-2.

It has been reported that COVID-19 tends to be more severe in the elderly and in patients with underlying diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and chronic lung disease. In severe cases, patients require intensive cares including mechanical ventilation in the ICUs. So far, no biomarker that predicts the severity, or no therapeutic strategies to prevent the development of severe diseases has been established. Pathology of severe COVID-19 has two aspects: viral overgrowth and excess pulmonary inflammation. For the former, clinical trials using existing drugs such as remdesivir (nucleic acid drug), lopinavir/ritonavir combination drug (protease inhibitor), favipravir (polymerase inhibitor), and interferon (antiviral drugs) are being conducted in patients with severe COVID-19 in China. Furthermore the interest has been focused on immune globulin preparations enriched with pathogen-specific antibodies collected from the plasma of recovered patients. For the latter, clinical studies using tocilizumab (IL-6 receptor antibody) and ACE2 protein have been conducted with the purpose of reducing excessive inflammation of the lung. In addition, single cell analysis of immune cells and comprehensive repertoire analysis of TCR/BCR using patient blood are in progress overseas, which are useful to elucidate the mechanism of the severe disease progression and identify the useful biomarkers for it.&lt;/p&gt;","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007811487'}","ES-4","","0.0","","20","日本薬理学会年会要旨集","2","93.0","{'@id': 'https://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/130007811487.json'}","新型コロナウイルスに対する重症化阻止治療"
